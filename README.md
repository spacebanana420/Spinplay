# Spinplay
Spinplay is a lightweight media player that uses FFplay in the backend for playing images, video and audio.

Spinplay has a built-in TUI file explorer for navigating your directories and files through the terminal, as well as commands and a configuration file to give you more power. You can also launch multiple instances of FFplay, or use the file browser while FFplay is running.


Spinplay was until just now a Bash script, and only recently I replaced it with the new Ruby rewrite.

# Download
Spinplay is officially tested on Linux and Windows, but it's designed to be highly portable and so it should work on many more operating systems
