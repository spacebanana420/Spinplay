# Spinplay
Spinplay is a Ruby (previously Bash) front-end that uses FFplay for more extensive and convenient media playback from the CLI.

Spinplay has a built-in TUI file explorer for navigating your directories and files through the terminal. You can also launch multiple instances of FFplay, or use the file browser while FFplay is running.

### Note

Spinplay was until just now a Bash front-end. I am now rewriting it in Ruby with more capabilities, speed and cross-platform in mind.

# Download
Spinplay should work in multiple operative systems, but it's currently only officially tested for Linux systems and Windows

Once the new Spinplay gets released, download it from the Releases page. You also need to install Ruby and FFmpeg

## Requirements

### New Spinplay
* Ruby
* FFmpeg (in your PATH)

### Old Spinplay
* Bash
* FFmpeg (in your PATH)
