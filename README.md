# Spinplay
Spinplay is a Ruby (previously Bash) front-end that uses FFplay for more extensive and convenient media playback from the CLI.

Spinplay has a built-in TUI file explorer for navigating your directories and files through the terminal. You can also launch multiple instances of FFplay, or use the file browser while FFplay is running.

### Note

Spinplay was until just now a Bash front-end. I am now rewriting it in Ruby with more capabilities, speed and cross-platform in mind.

# Download
Spinplay should work in multiple operative systems, but it's currently only officially tested for Linux systems and Windows
